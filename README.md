## 💻 Project

An application where your main objective is to refactor a page for listing films according to genre, to practice a little more about componentization in React. A challenge from [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/)'s Ignite journey.

## 🚀 Technologies

This project was developed with the following technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## 🔖 Layout

Created from Rocketseat [template](https://github.com/rocketseat-education/ignite-template-componentizando-a-aplicacao).

## ℹ️ How To Use

<p>To clone and run this application, you'll need <a href="https://git-scm.com" rel="nofollow">Git</a> and  <a href="https://legacy.yarnpkg.com" rel="nofollow">Yarn</a>. From your command line:</p>
    <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
      <pre><span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> Clone the repository</span>
$ git clone https://github.com/gisabernardess/movies-list.git <br/>
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> Go into the directory</span>
$ <span class="pl-c1">cd</span> movies-list <br/>
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> Install dependencies</span>
$ yarn <br/>
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> Run the fake api</span>
$ yarn server <br/>
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> Run the development server</span>
$ yarn dev <br/>
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> Navigate to http://localhost:8080</span>
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.</span></pre>
</div>

## ✨ Features

The application is already fully functional but much of its code is directly in the <code>App.tsx</code> file. To solve this in the best way, it is necessary to divide the application into at least two main parts: sidebar and the main content that has the header and the list of films.

- The application has only one main feature, which is the list of films;
- In the sidebar it is possible to select which category of films should be listed;
- The first category on the list (which is "Ação") should already start as checked;
- The application header has only the name of the selected category that must change dynamically;
